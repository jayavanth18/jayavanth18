## 💫 About Me

I am an **AI/ML-focused Computer Science undergraduate** pursuing **B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML)** at **VIT-AP University**, with a strong interest in building **robust, evaluation-driven, and deployment-aware machine learning systems**.

My work spans **Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**, where I focus not just on model accuracy, but also on **data quality, benchmarking, efficiency, and reproducibility**. I enjoy experimenting with **Transformer-based models**, hybrid ML approaches, and applying deep learning techniques to **real-world domains such as healthcare, finance, and social media analysis**.

I actively use GitHub to document experiments, compare architectures, and maintain clean, well-structured ML pipelines that reflect both **research rigor and engineering discipline**.
